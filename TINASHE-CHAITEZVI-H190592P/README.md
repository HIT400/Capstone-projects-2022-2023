# Smart Civic Issues Reporter

## Problem Statement
Citizens are often dissatisfied with the surrounding or urban infrastructure, but may not prefer traditional grievance systems that have to go through lengthy procedures such as going to the office and waiting in line for hours. This can lead to a lack of communication between citizens and government agencies, which can make it difficult to identify and address problems. In addition, traditional grievance systems can be time-consuming and inefficient, which can delay the resolution of problems.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application that makes it easy for citizens to report complaints and participate in the decision-making process, along with a web portal where officials can manage the reported issues. The application will be easy to use and accessible to everyone, regardless of their age or technical expertise. It will also provide a transparent and efficient way for civil servants to address complaints.

## Objectives
- Automatically geotag the reported complaints using the mobile application.
- Manage civic complaints and update their resolution status via the web application.
- Highlight the areas of the reported issues on a map using map markers.
- Classify feedback from citizens to gain an overview of the damage severity using image processing techniques.
- Generate data-driven analysis reports to provide intelligent insights for decision making.

## Technologies Used
- React Native with Expo for mobile application development.


## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.


2. **Install dependencies:**
This command will navigate to your project directory and install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. **Configure environment variables (if applicable):**
- Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
- Add any necessary environment variables to the file, such as API keys or configuration settings.

4. **Run the application on a development server:**
- For iOS:
  ```
  npx react-native run-ios
  ```
  This command will start the iOS simulator and launch the application.
- For Android:
  ```
  npx react-native run-android

  Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a physical Android device connected via USB.

5. **Verify the installation:**
- You should see the React Native application running on the simulator or device.

6. **Proceed**
- Open the project in your preferred code editor.
- Modify the code in the `src` directory to build your application.

7. **Build and deploy the application:**
- For iOS:
  - Configure the necessary certificates and provisioning profiles.
  - Build the release version:
    ```
    npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release
    ```
- For Android:
  - Configure the necessary signing keys and build settings.
  - Build the release version:
    ```
    npx react-native run-android --variant=release
    ```

These setup instructions provide a general guideline for setting up a React Native project. Make sure to adjust the instructions based on your specific project requirements and any additional configuration steps necessary for your development environment or target platforms.

Feel free to copy and paste these instructions into your README.md file and modify them as needed to fit your project.
